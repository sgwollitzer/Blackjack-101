  <h1>History of Blackjack</h1>
  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>Blackjack originated in France and Spain under the name "Vingt-un" or "Vingt-et-un", meaning "21." It was predated by other games circling Europe that had goals of getting as close to a certain value as psosible, whether it be 15, 31, or 21.</p>
  <p>Around the time of WWI, "21" came to the US with a twist: a reward was given if a player had an ace of spades and a blackjack. This reward and its name cuaght on and the game of "21" became the game of "Backjack" in the US. Finally, in 1931, Nevada created house-banked blackjack.</p>
  <h2>Blackjack's Most Famous Players</h2>
  <p>Jess Marcum was possibly the first card counter. Although the official strategy had yet to be created, Jess was kicked out of many casinos for creating a strategy that allowed him to "beat" blackjack.</p>
  <p>Baldwin, Cantey, Maisel, and McDermott wrote a book together about strategy and how to remember cards to increase your odds of winning.</p>
  <p>Edward Thorp detailed a "ten-count system" in the book Beat the Dealer that became one of the most famous card counting strategies to ever exist.</p>
  <h2>
    Now
  </h2>
  <p>Blackjack remains to be one of the most profitable games at a casino. However, casinos have measures in place to track card counting, and individuals caught card counting are often throw out of and banned from the casino.</p>
